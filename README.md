Description

This project showcases SQL queries I created for managing and analyzing employee and department data. The queries are designed to retrieve, filter, and group information efficiently.

Database Schema

In this project, I worked with two main tables:

Employees

employee_id (Primary Key)

name

salary

department_id (Foreign Key referencing departments.department_id)

Departments

department_id (Primary Key)

department_name

SQL Queries

This project includes the following types of SQL queries:

SELECT queries to fetch employee and department details.

WHERE clauses to filter data based on conditions (e.g., filtering employees by ID).

GROUP BY queries to organize data by department.

Aggregation functions like SUM, AVG, and MIN to calculate totals, averages, and minimum values.

Getting Started

Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the .sql file in your preferred SQL editor.

Run the queries on your SQL server or database to explore and analyze employee and department data.

Requirements

To run these queries, youâ€™ll need:

A running SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

A database schema containing tables such as employees and departments (you can create these using the provided schema).

How to Use

Ensure you have a MySQL-compatible database set up.

Create the employees and departments tables with the given schema.

Insert sample data.

Run the queries to test and analyse the results.
